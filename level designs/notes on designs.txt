Notes for design 1:

- S = Speed Pickup
- C = Crystal Pickup
- Pickups will be present from the start of the game, but will be limited in number, to allow some player choice whether they collect them or not
- ES = Enemy Spawner
- Start level at entry (portal from previous level)
- Collect all crystals to unlock the door
- Enemies need to be avoided, obstacles make this harder


notes for tutorial design:

- no enemy spawners
- one crystal, C, that opens the gate
- portal that takes player to next level
- no pickups
- Gate that the player needs to open to move to next level
- Curiousity should make the player pick up the crystal and move through the portal
- PS = Player Start
