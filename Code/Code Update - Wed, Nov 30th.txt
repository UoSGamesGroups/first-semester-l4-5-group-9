Bugs fixed:
Teleporter 'sensitivity' increased, now more compatible with our reaction mechanics.
walls now interact with game object as though 'solid'


Additions:
2 New enemy type added (to be altered as discussed).
New pickups added and relevant code to achieve desired effect of 'Crystal' game object (including point scoring, kill enemies, destroy border).
Game object obstacles which can be interacted with to creatively complete player goals.
Specific doors and keys (and script) created to give greater control over level design.
Trigger spawners added in addition to timed spawners - will allow greater configuration over game diffuculty.



Issues Im already aware of and aim to fix during next sprint:
Issue regarding player health:overcharge state.
