Bugs fixed:
Enemies now take damage from bullets fired with the updated mouse aim/fire code.
Projectile velocity no longer effects velocity of enemies and interferes with their behaviour.
'bullet power up' effect altered to enable ability with mouse shooting. enhanced fire mode interaction with enemies also changed.



Additions:
Basic fog of war mechanic added whereby area of environment visible to the player is reduced on player taking damage.
Updated 8 way movement controls using W, A, S and D keys (amended code should better allow for more straightforward implementation of sprite animation code).
Now able to aim with mouse cursor and shoot projectile towards mouse cursor location on mouse click.
Player sprite permanently oriented towards mouse cursor.




Issues Im already aware of and aim to fix during next sprint:
Will need to reconsider player movement speed vs. enemy movement speed vs. bullet movement speed
