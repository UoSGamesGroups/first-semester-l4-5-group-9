Bugs fixed:
'Zombie' enemy type now interacts with player controlled projectiles while tracking the player.
Teleporter 'sensitivity' increased slightly to lessen the need to repeatedly move across (Not perfect, though if increased too greatly an inescapable loop between teleporters is produced).

Additions:
Ability Pick ups added-
Health Pack, raises player health pool by 1. (added a '+4' state to player health incase player already has full health on health pack pick up so the feature can be demonstrated)
Speed Boost, temporarily doubles players move speed in all directions. Timer added to control duration. 
Scatter Shot, temporarily allows player to shoot multiple projectiles. Each projectiles collider size also increased. Timer added to control duration.

Issues Im already aware of and aim to fix during next sprint:
Addition of shoot power up has interfered with existing code that provided directional control for projectiles.
(will also review teleporter code if I find an appropriate way to improve it).
